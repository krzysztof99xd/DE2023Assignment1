        <p> A stroke is a medical emergency, and ischemic stroke shares similarities with myocardial infarction in terms of its underlying cause, which is the loss of blood supply to tissue. This can lead to irreversible damage if blood flow is not promptly restored. It is crucial to raise public awareness about the early signs of stroke, and individuals experiencing them should promptly seek medical assistance by using emergency transport services.</p>
